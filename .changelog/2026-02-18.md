## 08:00 — Stability & Mobile UX: Process Handlers, Mobile Nav, AuthContext, Dep Cleanup

**Task:** Autonomous iteration — simplicity, logic, stability, lean

**Changes (7 files):**

**Mobile navigation (critical UX fix):**
- frontend/src/components/PublicNav.tsx — Added hamburger menu for mobile; dropdown shows all nav links + Sign in on small screens
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Added same hamburger menu to Landing's custom nav (includes #features, #how-it-works anchor links)

**Backend stability (critical):**
- backend/src/server.ts — Added process.on('uncaughtException') with graceful shutdown and process.on('unhandledRejection') with logging
- backend/src/worker.ts — Same handlers for the standalone worker process

**Frontend performance:**
- frontend/src/lib/auth.tsx — Memoized AuthContext.Provider value with useMemo to prevent cascade re-renders across 83 useAuth consumers
- frontend/package.json — Removed unused @tanstack/react-query dependency (was installed but never imported)
- package-lock.json — Updated lockfile

**Decisions:**
- Landing keeps its own nav (has #features and #how-it-works anchor links unique to that page) — only mobile menu was added
- uncaughtException triggers graceful shutdown (same as SIGTERM); unhandledRejection only logs (to avoid killing process for recoverable issues)
- react-query removed rather than adopted — direct axios calls are simpler for current scale, no need for request deduplication yet

**Status:** completed

## 10:00 — Messaging Consistency: Source Counts, Model Counts, Rate Limit, Show HN Polish

**Task:** Autonomous iteration — consistency audit across all public-facing content

**Changes (5 files):**

**Show HN strategy updated:**
- docs/show-hn-strategy.md — Fixed "13 sources" → "16 sources", "33 models" → "40 models", "16 queues" → "20 queues"; updated founder comment (removed LinkedIn/Intercom/Zendesk/demo from "What's next" since they're built); marked completed checklist items

**Pricing page consistency:**
- frontend/src/pages/Pricing.tsx — Fixed 3 occurrences of "13 sources" → "16 sources" (Pro features, comparison table, FAQ answer)

**README numbers updated:**
- README.md — Fixed "33 models" → "40 models", "16 Queues" → "20 Queues" throughout architecture diagram and tech stack table

**Demo rate limit for HN launch:**
- backend/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts — Bumped demo limiter from 3/min to 10/min per IP (prevents 429s during HN traffic spike while still blocking abuse)

**Decisions:**
- 40 models verified by `grep -c "^model " backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- 20 queues verified by counting QUEUE_NAMES entries in backend/src/jobs/queue.ts
- Demo rate limit 10/min is conservative enough to prevent abuse but generous for legitimate HN visitors
- Founder comment "What's next" now lists forward-looking features (ML scoring, enrichment v2, Slack bot) instead of already-built items

**Status:** completed

## 10:30 — Demo UX Polish: Nav Filtering, PQA Explainer, Source Labels

**Task:** Autonomous iteration — remove dead-end navigation for demo visitors, add context

**Changes (3 files):**

**Demo-aware navigation:**
- frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — Added `hideInDemo` flag to NavItem interface; hid 10 items for demo visitors (Enrichment, Playbooks, Sequences, Webhooks, API Usage, Team, Billing, Audit Log, SSO, Data Export); demo detection via org name match; entire sections hidden when all items filtered

**PQA scoring context:**
- frontend/src/pages/PQADashboard.tsx — Expanded subtitle to explain the scoring tiers inline: HOT (70+), WARM (40-69), COLD (20-39), INACTIVE (<20) — so demo visitors immediately understand what scores mean

**Signal source completeness:**
- frontend/src/pages/SignalFeed.tsx — Added LinkedIn, Intercom, Zendesk, Clearbit to SOURCE_TYPES, SOURCE_TYPE_LABELS, and SOURCE_TYPE_COLORS (was missing 4 of 16 sources)

**Decisions:**
- Kept Workflows visible for demo (demo seed creates 2 workflows with real data)
- Kept Scoring Rules visible (shows the no-code rule builder which is a key differentiator)
- Kept Analytics and Deals visible (have demo data to show)
- Hiding Settings section entirely in demo (only Integrations + Scoring Rules remain, which still warrant the section)

**Status:** completed

## 10:45 — Source Type Completeness: Signals + ActivityTimeline

**Task:** Autonomous iteration — ensure all 16 signal sources render with proper color badges

**Changes (2 files):**
- frontend/src/pages/Signals.tsx — Added 10 missing source type colors (PyPI, Discord, Twitter, Stack Overflow, Reddit, PostHog, LinkedIn, Intercom, Zendesk, Clearbit) — was showing gray fallback for most signal sources
- frontend/src/components/ActivityTimeline.tsx — Added 7 missing source type branches to getSignalSourceBg function for consistent badge colors in company/contact timelines

**Status:** completed

## 09:30 — Demo Mode Polish: Onboarding Hints, Cleanup Cron, Conversion Banner

**Task:** Autonomous iteration — demo mode UX improvements for Show HN readiness

**Changes (8 files):**

**New: Demo onboarding overlay:**
- frontend/src/components/DemoOnboardingHints.tsx — NEW: 4-step guided callout overlay for demo visitors (Welcome → Signal Feed → PQA Scores → CTA to register). Fixed bottom-right card, sessionStorage once-per-session, highlights sidebar elements via data-tour attributes
- frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — Added DemoOnboardingHints render inside authenticated layout

**New: Demo cleanup cron job:**
- backend/src/jobs/queue.ts — Added DEMO_CLEANUP queue, DemoCleanupJobData type, demoCleanupQueue instance
- backend/src/jobs/workers.ts — Added demo cleanup worker: finds orgs with slug starting 'devsignal-demo' older than 24h, calls cleanupDemoOrg for each
- backend/src/jobs/scheduler.ts — Added daily 4 AM UTC cron for demo cleanup
- backend/src/jobs/index.ts — Exported new queue and type
- backend/src/services/demo-seed.ts — Exported cleanupDemoOrg function (was private)

**Enhanced: Demo conversion banner:**
- frontend/src/components/DemoModeBanner.tsx — Rewritten with dual CTAs: green "Start Free — 2 min setup" button + "Connect GitHub" secondary link. Shows "8 accounts, 395 signals, AI briefs — all interactive" messaging. Dismissible per session.

**Decisions:**
- Demo orgs cleaned after 24h (not 1h) — gives visitors time to return and explore more
- Onboarding overlay uses sessionStorage not localStorage — shows once per browser session, reappears if visitor returns later
- DemoModeBanner dismiss is useState (not persisted) — reappears on page reload to keep conversion CTA visible
- Cleanup cron at 4 AM UTC avoids overlap with score-snapshot cron at 2 AM

**Status:** completed
