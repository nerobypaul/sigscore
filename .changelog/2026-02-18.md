## 08:00 — Stability & Mobile UX: Process Handlers, Mobile Nav, AuthContext, Dep Cleanup

**Task:** Autonomous iteration — simplicity, logic, stability, lean

**Changes (7 files):**

**Mobile navigation (critical UX fix):**
- frontend/src/components/PublicNav.tsx — Added hamburger menu for mobile; dropdown shows all nav links + Sign in on small screens
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Added same hamburger menu to Landing's custom nav (includes #features, #how-it-works anchor links)

**Backend stability (critical):**
- backend/src/server.ts — Added process.on('uncaughtException') with graceful shutdown and process.on('unhandledRejection') with logging
- backend/src/worker.ts — Same handlers for the standalone worker process

**Frontend performance:**
- frontend/src/lib/auth.tsx — Memoized AuthContext.Provider value with useMemo to prevent cascade re-renders across 83 useAuth consumers
- frontend/package.json — Removed unused @tanstack/react-query dependency (was installed but never imported)
- package-lock.json — Updated lockfile

**Decisions:**
- Landing keeps its own nav (has #features and #how-it-works anchor links unique to that page) — only mobile menu was added
- uncaughtException triggers graceful shutdown (same as SIGTERM); unhandledRejection only logs (to avoid killing process for recoverable issues)
- react-query removed rather than adopted — direct axios calls are simpler for current scale, no need for request deduplication yet

**Status:** completed
