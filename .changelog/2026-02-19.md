## 10:15 — UX audit and high-impact fixes

**Task:** Comprehensive UX audit across nav, forms, integrations, and tables — then fix the highest-impact issues

**Audit Findings (3 parallel agents):**
- Nav/page flow: Settings section collapsed by default hiding key features
- Integrations: Marketplace and Settings are disconnected — 12 integrations have Settings setup but marketplace shows dead "coming soon" fields
- Forms/tables: Deal form defaults to wrong stage, ScoringBuilder delete has no confirmation, contact form grids break on mobile

**Changes:**
- Layout.tsx — Settings section now expanded by default (was collapsed, hiding Integrations, Billing, Team, etc.)
- Deals.tsx — Deal creation form default stage changed from ANONYMOUS_USAGE to IDENTIFIED (the first real pipeline stage for creating deals manually)
- ScoringBuilder.tsx — Added confirmation dialog before deleting scoring rules (was instant, no undo)
- Contacts.tsx — Fixed 2 form grids to be responsive (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 instead of just grid-cols-2)
- IntegrationDetail.tsx — Added SETTINGS_TAB_MAP for 12 integrations with Settings setup flows; "not connected" state now shows "Configure in Settings" CTA linking to `/settings?tab={id}` instead of disabled fields with "coming soon"
- Settings.tsx — Added URL query parameter support (`?tab=hubspot`) so IntegrationDetail deep-links work

**Decisions:**
- Chose IDENTIFIED over ANONYMOUS_USAGE as default deal stage because manual deal creation implies a known contact
- Kept marketplace "not connected" view for integrations without Settings tabs (npm, PyPI, GitHub, etc.) — those show config fields as disabled with "coming soon via API" messaging
- Used window.confirm() for ScoringBuilder delete (consistent with existing confirm patterns across the app)

**Status:** completed
