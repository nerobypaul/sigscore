## 00:30 — GTM Launch Prep: Marketing, SEO, Comparison Pages, Repo Polish

**Task:** Execute go-to-market preparation cycle — create launch content, add analytics/SEO, build comparison pages, prepare GitHub repo for public launch

**Changes (5 parallel agents):**
- marketing/show-hn.md — Ready-to-paste Show HN post (~250 words), honest technical tone, links to live demo and GitHub
- marketing/outreach-templates.md — 5 cold email templates targeting engineering leaders, DevRel, growth, founders, and sales at devtool companies
- frontend/index.html — Added Plausible analytics (privacy-friendly, no cookies) + JSON-LD structured data (SoftwareApplication schema with all 4 pricing tiers)
- frontend/src/pages/CompareCommonRoom.tsx — Full comparison page: DevSignal vs Common Room ($0 vs $1K+/mo), feature table, "why choose" section, CTAs
- frontend/src/pages/CompareReodev.tsx — Full comparison page: DevSignal vs Reo.dev ($0 vs $500+/mo), feature table, signal depth comparison, CTAs
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added /compare/common-room and /compare/reo-dev as public routes
- README.md — Added Live Demo section, updated all API URLs to production, fixed footer links (removed dead docs/twitter, added live demo + GitHub)
- LICENSE — MIT license file (was missing from repo root)
- pauls-to-dos.md — Added prioritized manual tasks section at top (10 items: domain, Stripe, Resend, OAuth, Sentry, Plausible, npm publish, repo public, Show HN)

**Decisions:**
- Used Plausible over Google Analytics for privacy (no cookies, GDPR-compliant, aligns with developer audience)
- Comparison pages are public routes (no auth) for SEO — they serve as landing pages for organic search
- Show HN post keeps technical tone, mentions dead PLG CRM competitors, emphasizes open source and self-hostable
- Outreach templates are under 150 words each, written in developer voice, not marketing speak

**Status:** completed

## 09:00 — Production Testing & Bug Fixes

**Task:** Comprehensive production site testing — API endpoints, auth flows, user click-through audit

**Changes:**
- Dockerfile — Added `npx prisma migrate deploy` to CMD for auto-migration on startup
- backend/src/services/signals.ts — Validate sourceId exists before insert (was returning 500 FK violation)
- backend/src/controllers/signals.ts — Catch 400 errors from signal service
- backend/src/routes/seo.ts — Added /compare/common-room, /compare/reo-dev, /changelog to sitemap

**Bugs found & fixed:**
- P0: Search returning 500 because search_vector column migration wasn't applied to production → Fixed with auto-migrate in Dockerfile
- P1: Signal ingest returning 500 on invalid sourceId → Now returns 400 with actionable error message
- P2: Sitemap missing new comparison pages and changelog

**Status:** completed

## 09:20 — UX Audit Fix Cycle (8 issues from browser click-through)

**Task:** Fix all P0/P1 issues found by automated Playwright browser audit of production site

**Changes:**
- backend/src/app.ts — CSP now allows plausible.io scripts (was blocking analytics on every page), added Permissions-Policy header
- backend/src/routes/changelog.ts — Fixed path resolution for Docker (use process.cwd() instead of __dirname)
- Dockerfile — Copy .changelog/ directory into Docker image (was missing, causing empty changelog page)
- frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx — Added GitHub + Google OAuth buttons (matching Login page)
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added /dashboard → / and /demo → /landing redirects
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Replaced fake testimonials with value proposition cards, added comparison page links, improved demo button redirect

**Decisions:**
- Used Permissions-Policy via custom middleware (not helmet option) due to TypeScript type limitations
- Changelog API uses process.cwd() which works in both dev (project root) and Docker (/app)
- Testimonials replaced with labeled value prop cards — avoids fake social proof problem for HN audience

**Status:** completed

## 09:50 — Pre-Launch Polish: Footer Consistency & Compilation Audit

**Task:** Final pre-launch hardening — verify TS compilation, fix UI inconsistencies, audit content quality

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/UseCases.tsx — Expanded footer from 4 links to 8 (added Developers, Changelog, Terms, Privacy)
- frontend/src/pages/Pricing.tsx — Same footer expansion to match Landing and Comparison pages

**Verification passed:**
- Backend TypeScript: 0 errors
- Frontend TypeScript: 0 errors
- Frontend build: 277KB initial bundle (gzip: 87KB)
- Production health: DB up (1.5s latency), Redis up (153ms)
- Demo API: /demo/status returns 200, demo org exists
- Changelog API: 200, returning entries
- Content pages (Use Cases, Comparison): reviewed, quality is strong

**Decisions:**
- Settings chunk (189KB) deferred — it's lazy-loaded and behind auth, won't affect HN first-visit
- All public pages now have identical 8-link footers for consistent navigation

**Status:** completed

## 10:10 — Navigation & Page Behavior Audit

**Task:** Comprehensive audit of navigation consistency and page behavior across all 13 public-facing pages

**Audit scope:** Landing, Use Cases, Pricing, CompareCommonRoom, CompareReodev, Changelog, Terms, Privacy, DevPortal, ApiDocs, Login, Register, NotFound + all redirects (/dashboard, /demo) and auth guards

**Issues found & fixed:**
- Changelog nav — was just "Back to Home" + Get Started, now matches standard pattern (Home | Use Cases | Pricing | Sign in | Get Started)
- Changelog footer — had 5 links, now has 8 matching other marketing pages
- Terms footer — had 3 links (Terms, Privacy, Home), now has 6 (Home, Pricing, Developers, Changelog, Terms, Privacy)
- Privacy footer — same expansion as Terms
- Changelog ArrowLeftIcon — removed unused component after nav change

**Verified working:**
- All 15 public routes return 200
- /dashboard redirects to / (client-side via React Router)
- /demo redirects to /landing (client-side)
- Auth pages (/login, /register) redirect authenticated users to /
- Protected routes serve SPA shell (ProtectedRoute handles auth check client-side)
- 404 catch-all renders NotFound page with navigation links

**Nav pattern summary:**
- Marketing pages (Landing, Use Cases, Pricing, Comparison, Changelog): Standard nav (Home | Use Cases | Pricing | Sign in | Get Started)
- Docs pages (DevPortal, ApiDocs): Docs-style nav with search bar
- Auth pages (Login, Register, ForgotPassword): Standalone form, no nav
- Legal pages (Terms, Privacy): Minimal header with cross-link
- 404: Centered logo + action buttons

**Status:** completed

## 10:30 — Critical Fix: Root URL Now Shows Landing Page for Visitors

**Task:** Root URL `/` was redirecting unauthenticated visitors to `/login` instead of showing the marketing landing page — critical Show HN launch blocker

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added conditional route: unauthenticated visitors see Landing at `/`, logged-in users see Dashboard. Changed `/demo` redirect from `/landing` to `/`
- 11 pages updated — All `to="/landing"` links changed to `to="/"` so `/` is the canonical home URL (CompareCommonRoom, CompareReodev, NotFound, DevPortal, ApiDocs, SharedReport, UseCases, Pricing, Terms, Privacy, Changelog)

**Decisions:**
- `/landing` still works as an alias (route remains), but all internal links now point to `/`
- Conditional rendering via `{!isAuthenticated && <Route path="/" element={<Landing />} />}` — clean, no flash of login redirect

**Status:** completed

## 11:00 — UX Polish Cycle: Shared Nav/Footer, Integrations UI, Billing, Monitoring, API Usage Fix

**Task:** Fix 6 issues — inconsistent nav across pages, missing nav items, integrations tab overflow, billing page polish, monitoring/tracing, API usage tracking frontend noise

**Changes (20 files, net -400 lines):**

**Shared components (new):**
- frontend/src/components/PublicNav.tsx — Shared nav bar for all public pages (Home | Use Cases | Pricing | Developers + Sign in / Get Started) with active page highlighting via useLocation()
- frontend/src/components/PublicFooter.tsx — Shared footer (8 links: Home, Use Cases, Pricing, Developers, Changelog, Terms, Privacy, Sign in) + copyright

**Nav/footer consolidation (8 pages updated):**
- frontend/src/pages/UseCases.tsx — Replaced inline nav (~35 lines) and footer (~30 lines) with PublicNav/PublicFooter
- frontend/src/pages/Pricing.tsx — Same replacement (~60 lines nav, ~40 lines footer)
- frontend/src/pages/Changelog.tsx — Same replacement, removed unused Link import and BoltIcon component
- frontend/src/pages/CompareCommonRoom.tsx — Same replacement
- frontend/src/pages/CompareReodev.tsx — Same replacement
- frontend/src/pages/Terms.tsx — Replaced inline header/footer with PublicNav/PublicFooter
- frontend/src/pages/Privacy.tsx — Same, removed unused Link import
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Footer only replaced (nav kept unique for anchor links #features, #how-it-works)

**Integrations tab bar fix:**
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx — 19 flat tabs reorganized into 4 category groups (General, CRM, Communication, Signals) with horizontal scroll and dividers
- frontend/src/index.css — Added .scrollbar-hide utility for hidden scrollbar with scroll functionality

**Billing polish:**
- frontend/src/pages/Billing.tsx — Scale tier now shows "Contact Sales" mailto link instead of broken Stripe checkout button

**API usage tracking fix:**
- frontend/src/lib/api.ts — Added X-Client: web header to all frontend axios requests
- backend/src/middleware/api-usage.ts — Skips requests with X-Client: web header (only tracks external/SDK API calls)

**Monitoring: Request ID tracing:**
- backend/src/middleware/request-id.ts (new) — Assigns UUID per request (from X-Request-Id header or randomUUID), sets response header
- backend/src/types/express.d.ts — Added requestId to Express Request interface
- backend/src/app.ts — Registered requestIdMiddleware as first middleware
- backend/src/middleware/error.ts — Includes requestId in error log output

**Decisions:**
- Landing.tsx keeps its own nav (has anchor links to page sections) — only footer replaced
- Terms.tsx and Privacy.tsx keep their sticky TOC sidebar nav (that's content nav, not page nav)
- Tab groups chosen to match logical categories: General (config), CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce), Communication (Slack/Discord/Intercom/Zendesk), Signals (data sources)
- X-Client header approach is simple and doesn't require auth changes — any request from the SPA is tagged

**Status:** completed
