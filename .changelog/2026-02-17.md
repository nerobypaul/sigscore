## 00:30 — GTM Launch Prep: Marketing, SEO, Comparison Pages, Repo Polish

**Task:** Execute go-to-market preparation cycle — create launch content, add analytics/SEO, build comparison pages, prepare GitHub repo for public launch

**Changes (5 parallel agents):**
- marketing/show-hn.md — Ready-to-paste Show HN post (~250 words), honest technical tone, links to live demo and GitHub
- marketing/outreach-templates.md — 5 cold email templates targeting engineering leaders, DevRel, growth, founders, and sales at devtool companies
- frontend/index.html — Added Plausible analytics (privacy-friendly, no cookies) + JSON-LD structured data (SoftwareApplication schema with all 4 pricing tiers)
- frontend/src/pages/CompareCommonRoom.tsx — Full comparison page: DevSignal vs Common Room ($0 vs $1K+/mo), feature table, "why choose" section, CTAs
- frontend/src/pages/CompareReodev.tsx — Full comparison page: DevSignal vs Reo.dev ($0 vs $500+/mo), feature table, signal depth comparison, CTAs
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added /compare/common-room and /compare/reo-dev as public routes
- README.md — Added Live Demo section, updated all API URLs to production, fixed footer links (removed dead docs/twitter, added live demo + GitHub)
- LICENSE — MIT license file (was missing from repo root)
- pauls-to-dos.md — Added prioritized manual tasks section at top (10 items: domain, Stripe, Resend, OAuth, Sentry, Plausible, npm publish, repo public, Show HN)

**Decisions:**
- Used Plausible over Google Analytics for privacy (no cookies, GDPR-compliant, aligns with developer audience)
- Comparison pages are public routes (no auth) for SEO — they serve as landing pages for organic search
- Show HN post keeps technical tone, mentions dead PLG CRM competitors, emphasizes open source and self-hostable
- Outreach templates are under 150 words each, written in developer voice, not marketing speak

**Status:** completed
