## 00:30 — GTM Launch Prep: Marketing, SEO, Comparison Pages, Repo Polish

**Task:** Execute go-to-market preparation cycle — create launch content, add analytics/SEO, build comparison pages, prepare GitHub repo for public launch

**Changes (5 parallel agents):**
- marketing/show-hn.md — Ready-to-paste Show HN post (~250 words), honest technical tone, links to live demo and GitHub
- marketing/outreach-templates.md — 5 cold email templates targeting engineering leaders, DevRel, growth, founders, and sales at devtool companies
- frontend/index.html — Added Plausible analytics (privacy-friendly, no cookies) + JSON-LD structured data (SoftwareApplication schema with all 4 pricing tiers)
- frontend/src/pages/CompareCommonRoom.tsx — Full comparison page: DevSignal vs Common Room ($0 vs $1K+/mo), feature table, "why choose" section, CTAs
- frontend/src/pages/CompareReodev.tsx — Full comparison page: DevSignal vs Reo.dev ($0 vs $500+/mo), feature table, signal depth comparison, CTAs
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added /compare/common-room and /compare/reo-dev as public routes
- README.md — Added Live Demo section, updated all API URLs to production, fixed footer links (removed dead docs/twitter, added live demo + GitHub)
- LICENSE — MIT license file (was missing from repo root)
- pauls-to-dos.md — Added prioritized manual tasks section at top (10 items: domain, Stripe, Resend, OAuth, Sentry, Plausible, npm publish, repo public, Show HN)

**Decisions:**
- Used Plausible over Google Analytics for privacy (no cookies, GDPR-compliant, aligns with developer audience)
- Comparison pages are public routes (no auth) for SEO — they serve as landing pages for organic search
- Show HN post keeps technical tone, mentions dead PLG CRM competitors, emphasizes open source and self-hostable
- Outreach templates are under 150 words each, written in developer voice, not marketing speak

**Status:** completed

## 09:00 — Production Testing & Bug Fixes

**Task:** Comprehensive production site testing — API endpoints, auth flows, user click-through audit

**Changes:**
- Dockerfile — Added `npx prisma migrate deploy` to CMD for auto-migration on startup
- backend/src/services/signals.ts — Validate sourceId exists before insert (was returning 500 FK violation)
- backend/src/controllers/signals.ts — Catch 400 errors from signal service
- backend/src/routes/seo.ts — Added /compare/common-room, /compare/reo-dev, /changelog to sitemap

**Bugs found & fixed:**
- P0: Search returning 500 because search_vector column migration wasn't applied to production → Fixed with auto-migrate in Dockerfile
- P1: Signal ingest returning 500 on invalid sourceId → Now returns 400 with actionable error message
- P2: Sitemap missing new comparison pages and changelog

**Status:** completed

## 09:20 — UX Audit Fix Cycle (8 issues from browser click-through)

**Task:** Fix all P0/P1 issues found by automated Playwright browser audit of production site

**Changes:**
- backend/src/app.ts — CSP now allows plausible.io scripts (was blocking analytics on every page), added Permissions-Policy header
- backend/src/routes/changelog.ts — Fixed path resolution for Docker (use process.cwd() instead of __dirname)
- Dockerfile — Copy .changelog/ directory into Docker image (was missing, causing empty changelog page)
- frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx — Added GitHub + Google OAuth buttons (matching Login page)
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added /dashboard → / and /demo → /landing redirects
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Replaced fake testimonials with value proposition cards, added comparison page links, improved demo button redirect

**Decisions:**
- Used Permissions-Policy via custom middleware (not helmet option) due to TypeScript type limitations
- Changelog API uses process.cwd() which works in both dev (project root) and Docker (/app)
- Testimonials replaced with labeled value prop cards — avoids fake social proof problem for HN audience

**Status:** completed

## 09:50 — Pre-Launch Polish: Footer Consistency & Compilation Audit

**Task:** Final pre-launch hardening — verify TS compilation, fix UI inconsistencies, audit content quality

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/UseCases.tsx — Expanded footer from 4 links to 8 (added Developers, Changelog, Terms, Privacy)
- frontend/src/pages/Pricing.tsx — Same footer expansion to match Landing and Comparison pages

**Verification passed:**
- Backend TypeScript: 0 errors
- Frontend TypeScript: 0 errors
- Frontend build: 277KB initial bundle (gzip: 87KB)
- Production health: DB up (1.5s latency), Redis up (153ms)
- Demo API: /demo/status returns 200, demo org exists
- Changelog API: 200, returning entries
- Content pages (Use Cases, Comparison): reviewed, quality is strong

**Decisions:**
- Settings chunk (189KB) deferred — it's lazy-loaded and behind auth, won't affect HN first-visit
- All public pages now have identical 8-link footers for consistent navigation

**Status:** completed
