## 10:00 — P16: Team members with RBAC

**Task:** Build team member management with role-based access control
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/members.ts — Member service: list, invite by email, update role, remove, transfer ownership with atomic transaction
- backend/src/routes/members.ts — Member routes with zod validation, requireOrgRole middleware
- backend/src/middleware/auth.ts — Add requireOrgRole middleware (OWNER > ADMIN > MEMBER > VIEWER hierarchy), set orgRole on req
- backend/src/types/express.d.ts — Add orgRole to Express Request interface
- backend/src/routes/api-keys.ts — Enforce ADMIN role on create/revoke/delete
- backend/src/routes/bulk.ts — Enforce ADMIN role on all bulk operations
- backend/src/routes/slack-settings.ts — Enforce ADMIN role on all Slack settings
- backend/src/routes/webhooks.ts — Enforce ADMIN role on create/delete webhooks
- frontend/src/pages/TeamMembers.tsx — Full team page: member table with avatars, inline role selector, invite modal, remove confirmation, ownership transfer, role permissions legend
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Add /team route
- frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — Add Team sidebar nav link

**Decisions:**
- RBAC hierarchy: OWNER > ADMIN > MEMBER > VIEWER (not just boolean isAdmin)
- Sensitive routes (API keys, bulk ops, Slack, webhooks) all gated behind ADMIN
- Ownership transfer uses atomic Prisma transaction (demote + promote)
- Cannot self-demote or remove yourself for safety

**Status:** completed

## 10:15 — P17: Audit log — enterprise compliance trail

**Task:** Build audit log for enterprise compliance (who did what, when)
**Changes:**
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma — Add AuditLog model with 4 composite indexes
- backend/prisma/migrations/20260214000000_add_audit_log/migration.sql — CREATE TABLE + indexes
- backend/src/services/audit.ts — logAudit (fire-and-forget), getAuditLogs (cursor pagination, filters), getEntityHistory
- backend/src/routes/audit.ts — GET /audit (ADMIN, filterable), GET /audit/entity/:type/:id
- backend/src/controllers/contacts.ts — Audit calls on create/update/delete
- backend/src/controllers/deals.ts — Audit calls on create/update/delete (tracks stage changes)
- backend/src/controllers/companies.ts — Audit calls on create/update/delete
- backend/src/services/members.ts — Audit calls on invite, role_change, remove, transfer_ownership
- frontend/src/pages/AuditLog.tsx — Filter bar, color-coded action badges, expandable JSON diffs, cursor pagination, entity links
- frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — Audit Log sidebar nav link

**Decisions:**
- Fire-and-forget pattern for audit logging — never blocks API responses
- Audit log is ADMIN-only for viewing (entity history available to all members)
- Changes stored as `{ field: { from, to } }` JSON for update diffs

**Status:** completed

## 10:20 — P18: Saved views — custom filtered views

**Task:** Let users save and share filtered views of contacts, companies, and deals
**Changes:**
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma — Add SavedView model
- backend/prisma/migrations/20260214010000_add_saved_views/migration.sql — CREATE TABLE + indexes
- backend/src/services/saved-views.ts — CRUD + setDefault (unsets previous default per entity type)
- backend/src/routes/saved-views.ts — 5 endpoints with zod validation
- frontend/src/components/SavedViewSelector.tsx — Horizontal tab bar with context menu
- frontend/src/components/SaveViewModal.tsx — Name input, emoji picker, share toggle
- frontend/src/pages/Contacts.tsx — SavedViewSelector integration with filter sync
- frontend/src/pages/Companies.tsx — SavedViewSelector integration
- frontend/src/pages/Deals.tsx — SavedViewSelector with stage filter support

**Decisions:**
- Views can be personal or shared (isShared toggle)
- One default view per entity type per user
- Owner or ADMIN can modify any view, others can only modify their own
- Context menu on view tabs: rename, set default, share/unshare, delete

**Status:** completed

## 10:45 — P19: Segment inbound connector

**Task:** Build Segment webhook connector so customers can pipe existing analytics data into DevSignal
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/segment-connector.ts — Handle all 5 Segment call types: identify (contact upsert), track (signal), group (company upsert), page/screen (signal). HMAC-SHA1 signature verification. Batch payload support.
- backend/src/routes/segment-webhook.ts — POST /webhooks/segment/:sourceId (HMAC auth, not JWT)
- backend/src/routes/connectors.ts — ADMIN routes: create source (auto-gen secret), get config, rotate secret, delete
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx — Segment tab: connect flow, copyable webhook URL, show/hide secret, rotate/disconnect, setup instructions

**Decisions:**
- Always return 200 to Segment to avoid retries on app-level errors (log internally)
- Idempotency keys: `seg_${messageId}` prevents duplicate signals
- identify → contact upsert by email or anonymousId
- track → signal creation with workflow trigger fire-and-forget
- group → company upsert by domain, link calling user's contact

**Status:** completed

## 11:00 — P20: Account 360 — AI-powered company intelligence hub

**Task:** Transform CompanyDetail into a 5-tab Account 360 page that surfaces all existing AI endpoints
**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/CompanyDetail.tsx — Complete rewrite: Overview (score card, quick stats, recent signals/activities), Timeline (unified feed with type filters), Contacts (grid with AI enrich), Deals (pipeline view), AI Intelligence (brief panel, next-best-actions, scoring factors)
- frontend/src/components/AccountScoreCard.tsx — PQA score display with tier colors, trend arrows, factor bar breakdown
- frontend/src/components/AccountTimeline.tsx — Merged signal+activity+deal timeline with filter pills, load-more
- frontend/src/components/AIBriefPanel.tsx — AI brief with markdown renderer, freshness indicator, generate/regenerate

**Decisions:**
- No backend changes — all AI endpoints already existed (brief, suggest, enrich)
- Built-in markdown renderer (no deps) handles headers, bold, lists, paragraphs
- Score colors: HOT=red, WARM=amber, COLD=blue, INACTIVE=gray
- This is the "demo closer" page — the one that makes a VP of Sales say "I need this"

**Status:** completed

## Competitive Intelligence (researched this cycle)
- PLG CRM graveyard: Calixa ($16.3M) shut down, Koala ($15M) acqui-hired by Cursor, Endgame ($17M) pivoted away
- Survivors (Pocus, Correlated) pivoted to broader AI sales intelligence
- DevSignal's gap: "Reo.Dev + Attio in one box" — native developer signals + CRM, nobody else does this
- Price advantage: 5-12x cheaper than Common Room ($1k/mo), Warmly ($499/mo)
- Key lesson: niche down on devtools, don't try to be "PLG CRM for everyone"

## 11:30 — Rebrand: "Headless CRM" → "Developer Pipeline Intelligence"

**Task:** Full product rebrand based on ICP/GTM research
**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — New headline "Turn developer signals into pipeline", growth-focused copy throughout, ICP company social proof bar, "Talk to Us" CTA
- frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — Sidebar brand: "Headless CRM" → "DevSignal"
- frontend/index.html — Page title: "DevSignal — Developer Pipeline Intelligence"
- frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx — "pipeline intelligence" subtitle
- backend/src/app.ts — Service name: "devsignal", Swagger titles updated
- backend/src/config/swagger.ts — "DevSignal API" with growth-focused descriptions
- docs/strategy.md — Full strategy doc: ICP, USP, competitive landscape, pricing, roadmap

**Decisions:**
- Category: "Developer Pipeline Intelligence" (not CRM, not PLG CRM)
- Buyer: Head of Growth (not VP Sales) — "sales" alienates dev companies
- Positioning: "Reo.Dev + Attio in one box" at 5-12x lower price
- Name "DevSignal" is strong, keeping it
- The PLG CRM graveyard (Calixa, Koala, Endgame) validates niche focus on devtools

**Status:** completed

## Sprint Summary — P16-P20 + Rebrand (this session)
| Sprint | Feature | Lines |
|--------|---------|-------|
| P16 | Team Members + RBAC | +1,211 |
| P17 | Audit Log | +987 |
| P18 | Saved Views | +818 |

| P20 | Account 360 + AI | +1,432 |
| Rebrand | Developer Pipeline Intelligence | +136 |
| **Total** | | **~5,830** |

## 14:00 — GTM Content Package: Marketing launch materials

**Task:** Create comprehensive marketing content for DevSignal launch
**Changes:**
- docs/show-hn.md — Show HN post draft (~400 words, builder tone, authentic story about HubSpot not knowing what npm downloads are)
- docs/twitter-threads.md — 5 Twitter/X thread drafts (8-12 tweets each): PLG CRM graveyard, HubSpot fails devtools, development acceleration era, developer buying signals, building a CRM in 2 weeks with AI
- docs/cold-outreach-templates.md — 3 cold email templates (<100 words each): npm download personalized, GitHub stars provocation, soft question-based
- docs/content-calendar.md — 30-day content calendar: Week 1 (Show HN + launch), Week 2 (blog + depth), Week 3 (Product Hunt + acceleration), Week 4 (outreach + conversion). Includes daily rituals, metrics targets, content principles.

**Decisions:**
- Tone: builder-to-builder (Basecamp writing style, not corporate marketing)
- Every thread follows hook-story-CTA format
- Cold emails all under 100 words -- respect people's time
- Content calendar includes specific daily tasks, not just "post something"
- Metrics targets are conservative but measurable (50 signups Week 1, 200 by Week 4)
- Threads are data-driven: cite real funding amounts ($48M+ PLG CRM graveyard), real companies, real pricing comparisons

**Status:** completed

## 14:00 -- P23: Onboarding experience and demo data seeder

**Task:** Build demo data seeder and onboarding flow so new users see value in 60 seconds
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/demo-data.ts -- Demo data seeder: 5 companies, 12 contacts, 8 deals, 30 signals, 5 activities, PQA scores, tags, workflow, signal source. Idempotent via __demo_data sentinel tag. clearDemoData deletes all seeded records.
- backend/src/routes/demo.ts -- POST /demo/seed (idempotent), DELETE /demo/seed (clear), GET /demo/status (check). All require ADMIN role.
- backend/src/app.ts -- Mount demo routes at /api/v1/demo
- frontend/src/pages/Onboarding.tsx -- Added "Sample Data" step between Signals and Done. User chooses "Yes, load demo data" or "No, I'll add my own". Shows what gets created. Smooth transition to Done step.
- frontend/src/components/GettingStarted.tsx -- Rewritten as proper 5-step checklist: org, connect source, add contact, install SDK, invite team. Checks source count (excluding demo), member count. Shows completion percentage. Auto-hides when all done.
- frontend/src/components/DemoDataBanner.tsx -- Subtle indigo banner on dashboard when demo data exists. "Clear demo data" button calls DELETE /demo/seed and reloads page.
- frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx -- Added DemoDataBanner above GettingStarted

**Decisions:**
- Idempotency via sentinel tag (__demo_data) -- avoids double-seeding, enables targeted cleanup
- Demo companies use realistic-sounding fictional names (Acme Dev Tools, NovaCLI, CloudForge, DataPipe Labs, ByteStack)
- Onboarding step indicator widths reduced slightly to fit 5 steps
- GettingStarted checklist auto-hides when all steps complete
- Banner is subtle (indigo, not red/yellow) -- informational, not alarming

**Status:** completed

## 15:00 — P21: BullMQ async workers — reliable job processing

**Task:** Replace synchronous workflow/webhook processing with BullMQ queues
**Changes:**
- backend/src/jobs/scheduler.ts — Cron-based signal sync: npm every 6h, PyPI every 12h
- backend/src/jobs/queue.ts — Added signal-sync + workflow-execution queues with typed interfaces
- backend/src/jobs/workers.ts — Async worker functions with retry/backoff
- backend/src/jobs/producers.ts — Typed job enqueue functions
- backend/src/routes/workers.ts — GET /workers/status (ADMIN only) with queue stats
- backend/src/index.ts — ENABLE_WORKERS env var, graceful shutdown
- Controllers updated: processEvent → enqueueWorkflowExecution throughout
- backend/src/routes/connectors.ts — Sync endpoints use enqueueSignalSync

**Decisions:**
- Workers enabled via ENABLE_WORKERS=true (off by default for dev simplicity)
- Graceful shutdown: stopWorkers() + closeAllQueues() on SIGTERM
- Fixed DealStage 'FREE_SIGNUP' → 'IDENTIFIED' in slack-interactions

**Status:** completed

## 15:00 — P22: Interactive Slack bot — Block Kit alerts with action buttons

**Task:** Rich Slack notifications with interactive buttons for devtool growth teams
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/slack-blocks.ts — 5 Block Kit builders: account hot alert, signup alert, deal stage change, workflow failed, weekly digest
- backend/src/routes/slack-interactions.ts — Interaction handler: claim/snooze/view/dismiss with HMAC-SHA256 signing verification
- backend/src/services/slack-notifications.ts — Extended with sendSlackBlockMessage, sendAccountAlert, sendSignupAlert, sendDealAlert
- backend/src/routes/slack-settings.ts — Alert config + user map endpoints
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx — Rich Alerts UI: type toggles, Block Kit preview

**Decisions:**
- HMAC-SHA256 signing secret verification on all Slack interactions
- Snooze durations: 1h, 4h, 24h
- Alert types configurable per-org (hot_account, new_signup, deal_change, workflow_failed)

**Status:** completed

## 15:15 — Marketing pages: Use Cases and Pricing

**Task:** Add marketing pages for conversion funnel
**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/UseCases.tsx — 4 expandable use case cards with signal flow diagrams
- frontend/src/pages/Pricing.tsx — 3-tier pricing grid + 6 FAQ items + social proof bar
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Added /use-cases and /pricing routes
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Nav and footer links to new pages

**Status:** completed

## 15:15 — Marketing playbook: 30-day research-backed launch plan

**Task:** Save comprehensive marketing strategy based on devtool company research
**Changes:**
- docs/marketing-playbook.md — 8-part playbook: devtool case studies (Cursor, Supabase, Linear, Resend, Vercel), distribution channels ranked by impact, "development acceleration era" positioning, PLG CRM failure analysis, 30-day tactical plan, competitive positioning (vs Reo.Dev, Common Room), messaging framework, metrics targets

**Decisions:**
- Category: "Developer Pipeline Intelligence" (never "PLG CRM" — that category is poisoned)
- Show HN as highest-leverage channel (post 8:30am ET Tuesday)
- 10-minute time-to-value IS the marketing strategy

**Status:** completed

## Sprint Summary — P21-P23 + Marketing (this session, continued)
| Sprint | Feature | Lines |
|--------|---------|-------|
| P21 | BullMQ Async Workers | +382 |
| P22 | Interactive Slack Bot | +1,426 |
| P23 | Onboarding + Demo Data | +1,100 |
| Marketing | Content + Pages + Playbook | +1,200 |
| **Total** | | **~4,108** |

## 16:00 — P24: Email sequence automation

**Task:** Build automated multi-step email outreach triggered by signals
**Changes:**
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma — EmailSequence, EmailSequenceStep, EmailEnrollment, EmailSend models
- backend/prisma/migrations/20260214020000_add_email_sequences/ — Migration
- backend/src/services/email-sequences.ts — Full CRUD, enrollment management, template rendering with XSS sanitization
- backend/src/routes/email-sequences.ts — 16 endpoints: sequence CRUD, step management, enrollment, stats
- backend/src/jobs/producers.ts — enqueueEmailSend with delayed scheduling
- backend/src/jobs/queue.ts — email-send queue with retry/backoff config
- frontend/src/pages/EmailSequences.tsx — List page with status filters, inline create form
- frontend/src/pages/EmailSequenceDetail.tsx — Step timeline editor, enrollments table, stats dashboard

**Decisions:**
- Template variables: {{firstName}}, {{lastName}}, {{email}}, {{company}}, {{title}}, {{signalCount}}, {{pqaScore}}
- Email send is logged (provider not yet integrated — Resend/SendGrid is future step)
- Enrollment prevents duplicates via unique constraint on (sequenceId, contactId)
- Steps use negative temp values during reorder to avoid unique constraint conflicts

**Status:** completed

## 16:00 — P25: Custom dashboard builder

**Task:** Customizable metric dashboards that users open every morning
**Changes:**
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma — Dashboard model with JSON layout
- backend/prisma/migrations/20260214030000_add_dashboards/ — Migration
- backend/src/services/dashboards.ts — CRUD + 12 widget data fetchers
- backend/src/routes/dashboards.ts — 7 endpoints with zod validation
- frontend/src/pages/DashboardBuilder.tsx — Widget grid, add modal, SVG charts, auto-save

**Decisions:**
- 10 widget types: 4 stat cards, 3 list widgets, 3 chart widgets
- Auto-creates default dashboard on first visit
- Layout stored as JSON array, debounced 2s auto-save
- Charts are pure SVG/CSS — no external chart library
- Dashboard is per-user within an org (personal views)

**Status:** completed

## 16:00 — P26: HubSpot/Salesforce CRM import wizard

**Task:** One-click data migration from HubSpot and Salesforce CSV exports
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/crm-import.ts — HubSpot + Salesforce field maps, auto-detect format, upsert by email/domain, batch processing, stage mapping, audit logging
- backend/src/routes/crm-import.ts — 4 multer endpoints: detect, import contacts/companies/deals
- frontend/src/pages/CrmImport.tsx — 4-step wizard: choose source, upload files, preview mapping, see results

**Decisions:**
- Format auto-detection by scoring header columns against known HubSpot/Salesforce markers
- Upsert logic: non-destructive (only fills blank fields on existing records)
- Tagged with __hubspot_import or __salesforce_import for tracking
- Max 10,000 rows per file, batch processing in chunks of 100
- HubSpot stages mapped to PLG-native DealStage enum (ACTIVATED, TEAM_ADOPTION, etc.)

**Status:** completed

## 16:15 — Competitive research: feature prioritization

**Task:** Deep competitive analysis of Reo.dev, Common Room, Pocus, Attio
**Changes:**
- Research output consumed for P24-P26 prioritization

**Key findings:**
- CRM bi-directional sync is #1 blocker (every competitor has it)
- Customizable lead scoring is key retention driver (Pocus's moat)
- Email sequences close the value loop (signal → action)
- Import path collapses time-to-value for prospects already on HubSpot/Salesforce
- DevSignal advantage: public signal connectors require no engineering buy-in

**Status:** completed

## Sprint Summary — P24-P26 (this session, continued)
| Sprint | Feature | Lines |
|--------|---------|-------|
| P24 | Email Sequences | +2,399 |
| P25 | Custom Dashboards | +1,134 |
| P26 | CRM Import Wizard | +1,910 |

| P24-P26 | Sequences, Dashboards, CRM Import | ~5,472 |
| **Grand Total** | **16 features** | **~15,410** |

## 17:00 -- P27: Zero-setup GitHub onboarding (aha moment in 60 seconds)

**Task:** Build a zero-setup onboarding flow where new users connect GitHub and see company signals in under 2 minutes -- no SDK, no Segment, no code changes
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/github-onboarding.ts -- GitHub onboarding service: fetches user repos, crawls stargazers/forkers/issue authors (paginated), enriches profiles in batches of 10, resolves companies via GitHub company field + email domain, groups by company, creates Company/Contact/Signal records with idempotency, computes PQA scores, tracks real-time progress in memory
- backend/src/routes/github-onboarding.ts -- 3 routes: POST /github/repos (list repos for picker), POST /github/connect (run full crawl with rate limiting), GET /github/status (poll progress)
- backend/src/app.ts -- Mount onboarding routes at /api/v1/onboarding
- frontend/src/pages/Onboarding.tsx -- Complete rewrite: 3-step wizard (Create Org -> Connect GitHub -> See Results). Step 2: token input with auto-link to create PAT, repo picker with star/fork counts, auto-selects top 5. Crawl shows real-time progress bar with phase text. Step 3: stat cards (companies/developers/signals), top companies table with signal counts, Go to Dashboard CTA.

**Decisions:**
- Crawl is synchronous (not BullMQ) -- completes in <60s for typical repos, and the onboarding UX needs immediate results
- Rate-limited to 5 crawls per 15 minutes per IP to prevent GitHub API abuse
- Enriches max 200 developer profiles per crawl (GitHub rate limit safe at 5000/hr)
- Top 10 repos by stars to bound the crawl time
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate signals on re-crawl (gh-onboard:org:login:type:repo)
- Removed old 5-step flow (team invite, signal source picker, demo data) -- those are post-onboarding settings
- Company resolution chain: GitHub company field -> email domain (skip free providers) -> fallback to unknown
- Bots (login ending in [bot]) are automatically filtered out

**Status:** completed

## 17:30 — P28: Pre-built playbooks system (10 devtool-specific automations)

**Task:** Build a playbooks system with 10 devtool-specific pre-configured signal-driven automations that deliver value immediately
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/playbooks.ts — PlaybookTemplate type, 10 pre-built playbook definitions covering acquisition (4), expansion (2), retention (1), engagement (3). Service functions: listPlaybooks (with org activation status), activatePlaybook (creates real Workflow from template), getActivePlaybooks, deactivatePlaybook (soft-disable preserving run history).
- backend/src/routes/playbooks.ts — 4 routes: GET / (list all), GET /active (active for org), POST /:id/activate, DELETE /:id (deactivate). Auth: authenticate + requireOrganization + requireOrgRole(MEMBER).
- backend/src/app.ts — Mount playbook routes at /api/v1/playbooks
- frontend/src/pages/Playbooks.tsx — Card grid with toggle switches, category filter tabs (All/Acquisition/Expansion/Retention/Engagement), category-colored badges, action chips, tag pills, run count + last triggered stats for active playbooks
- frontend/src/App.tsx — Add /playbooks route
- frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx — Add Playbooks nav item with lightning bolt icon, placed after Workflows

**Playbooks included:**
1. Hot GitHub Accounts — 3+ devs starring/forking in 7 days -> deal + Slack
2. npm Surge Detection — 200%+ WoW download growth -> tag + Slack
3. Enterprise Signals — Large company signal -> deal + tag + Slack
4. Churning Developer Alert — 50%+ signal drop in 14 days -> churn-risk tag + Slack
5. Multi-Product Expansion — 3+ signal types -> expansion-ready tag
6. First-Time Evaluator — New contact -> deal + tag
7. Team Adoption Signal — 5+ unique devs -> team-adoption tag + Slack
8. GitHub Issue = Intent — Issue filed -> high-intent tag + Slack
9. Package Version Upgrade — Version upgrade -> active-adopter tag + Slack
10. Weekly Digest — Weekly Slack summary of top accounts

**Decisions:**
- Playbooks stored as workflow templates in code, not database -- versioned and deterministic
- Activation creates a real Workflow prefixed with "[Playbook]" so the workflow engine processes them identically
- Deactivation disables (soft-delete) rather than deleting, preserving run history
- Re-activation of a disabled playbook re-enables instead of creating a duplicate
- Category taxonomy: acquisition/expansion/retention/engagement maps to devtool growth funnel

**Status:** completed

## 18:00 -- P29: HubSpot bidirectional sync

**Task:** Push DevSignal's enriched developer signals INTO HubSpot so sales reps see them where they already work
**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/hubspot-sync.ts -- Full HubSpot sync service: OAuth2 token management with auto-refresh, custom property registration (PQA Score, Signal Count, etc. under DevSignal property group), contact sync by email (batch upsert), company sync by domain (batch upsert), deal sync by custom devsignal_deal_id (batch upsert), signal-to-note sync (push signals as Notes on HubSpot contacts), incremental sync by last-modified timestamp, getConnectedOrganizations for scheduler
- backend/src/routes/hubspot-sync.ts -- 4 ADMIN-only routes: POST /connect (store tokens, register properties), POST /sync (trigger full/incremental), GET /status (sync status with metrics), DELETE /disconnect (remove tokens)
- backend/src/jobs/queue.ts -- Added HUBSPOT_SYNC queue + HubSpotSyncJobData type + queue instance
- backend/src/jobs/producers.ts -- enqueueHubSpotSync with per-org deduplication
- backend/src/jobs/workers.ts -- HubSpot sync worker with scheduler sentinel handling (enqueues per-org jobs on cron tick)
- backend/src/jobs/scheduler.ts -- Added 15-minute cron for HubSpot sync, enqueueHubSpotSyncForAllConnected helper
- backend/src/app.ts -- Mount hubspotSyncRoutes at /api/v1/integrations
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx -- HubSpot tab: connect flow (token inputs), connected status card with stats grid (last sync, contacts/companies/deals synced), last sync result breakdown (created/updated/failed per entity), error display, Sync Now + Full Re-sync buttons, auto-polling during sync, disconnect, setup instructions with "what gets synced" grid

**Decisions:**
- Uses HubSpot REST API v3 batch endpoints for efficiency (up to 100 records per batch call)
- Contact matching by email, company matching by domain, deal matching by custom devsignal_deal_id property
- Custom properties auto-created in a "DevSignal" property group on first connect
- Incremental sync: only records modified since last sync timestamp
- Scheduler runs every 15 minutes using a sentinel job pattern (scheduler enqueues per-org jobs)
- Token refresh via OAuth2 refresh_token flow, transparent to sync logic
- Signal notes limited to 500 per sync to avoid overwhelming HubSpot
- Audit logging on connect, disconnect, and each sync completion

**Status:** completed

## Next Steps
- P30: Customizable lead scoring builder (no-code)
- P31: Multi-tenant SSO (SAML/OIDC)
- P32: API developer portal with interactive docs
