## 20:50 — SDK build verification and publish readiness

**Task:** Verify @devsignal/node SDK builds cleanly and is ready for npm publishing

**Changes:**
- package.json — added packages/sdk to workspaces array for proper monorepo integration

**Verification:**
- ✅ packages/sdk/package.json — properly configured with main/types/exports fields
- ✅ packages/sdk/tsconfig.json — ES2022 target, NodeNext modules, strict mode enabled
- ✅ packages/sdk/src/index.ts — exports DevSignal class and all resources
- ✅ Build output — 47 files in dist/ including .js, .d.ts, and .map files
- ✅ TypeScript declarations — complete type definitions generated
- ✅ README.md — comprehensive documentation with examples and API reference
- ✅ npm pack dry-run — validates correctly with all necessary files

**SDK Details:**
- Package: @devsignal/node@1.0.0
- Zero dependencies
- Node.js 18+ required
- ESM with full TypeScript support
- Resources: signals, contacts, companies, deals, scores
- Entry points: dist/index.js (main), dist/index.d.ts (types)
- Files included: dist/ directory only (47 files, ~30KB)

**Decisions:**
- Added SDK workspace to root package.json for consistent build commands
- SDK uses prepublishOnly script to ensure fresh build before publishing
- Package configured for dual ESM/CJS support via exports field

**Status:** completed — SDK is publish-ready. Can be published with \`npm publish --workspace=packages/sdk\`
