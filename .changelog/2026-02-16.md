## 14:30 — Landing page Show HN launch fixes

**Task:** Update landing page with accurate connector counts and honest value propositions for Show HN launch

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Updated all connector/integration counts from 13/14 to 16 to reflect current integrations (GitHub, npm, PyPI, Segment, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Discord, Stack Overflow, Twitter/X, Clearbit, Reddit, PostHog, LinkedIn, Intercom, Zendesk)
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Added 'LinkedIn' and 'Intercom' to integrations array (line 140)
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Replaced fake testimonials with honest value proposition cards that don't pretend to be customer quotes
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Changed testimonials section heading from "Loved by devtool growth teams" to "Why devtool teams choose DevSignal"
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Removed fake 5-star ratings from testimonial cards
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Changed "Join 50+ companies" claim to "Discover which developers are ready to buy — before they fill out a form"

**Specific count updates:**
- Line 97: Signal Engine metric "13 signal sources" → "16 signal sources"
- Line 199: Comparison table "13 built-in" → "16 built-in"
- Line 471: Hero metrics "14+" → "16+"
- Line 606: Integrations section "13 signal sources" → "16 signal sources"
- Line 812: Metrics bar "13" → "16"
- Line 977: Why DevSignal section "14 connectors" → "16 connectors"

**Decisions:**
- Chose to be completely honest about not having real testimonials — framed them as value propositions instead
- Removed all elements that could be misleading (star ratings, fake company counts)
- Maintained DevSignal's positioning against dead PLG CRM startups (Calixa, Koala, Toplyne, Endgame, Pocus)
- Emphasized the core value prop: signal detection before form-fill

**Status:** completed
