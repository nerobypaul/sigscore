## 14:30 — Landing page Show HN launch fixes

**Task:** Update landing page with accurate connector counts and honest value propositions for Show HN launch

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Updated all connector/integration counts from 13/14 to 16 to reflect current integrations (GitHub, npm, PyPI, Segment, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Discord, Stack Overflow, Twitter/X, Clearbit, Reddit, PostHog, LinkedIn, Intercom, Zendesk)
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Added 'LinkedIn' and 'Intercom' to integrations array (line 140)
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Replaced fake testimonials with honest value proposition cards that don't pretend to be customer quotes
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Changed testimonials section heading from "Loved by devtool growth teams" to "Why devtool teams choose DevSignal"
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Removed fake 5-star ratings from testimonial cards
- frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx — Changed "Join 50+ companies" claim to "Discover which developers are ready to buy — before they fill out a form"

**Specific count updates:**
- Line 97: Signal Engine metric "13 signal sources" → "16 signal sources"
- Line 199: Comparison table "13 built-in" → "16 built-in"
- Line 471: Hero metrics "14+" → "16+"
- Line 606: Integrations section "13 signal sources" → "16 signal sources"
- Line 812: Metrics bar "13" → "16"
- Line 977: Why DevSignal section "14 connectors" → "16 connectors"

**Decisions:**
- Chose to be completely honest about not having real testimonials — framed them as value propositions instead
- Removed all elements that could be misleading (star ratings, fake company counts)
- Maintained DevSignal's positioning against dead PLG CRM startups (Calixa, Koala, Toplyne, Endgame, Pocus)
- Emphasized the core value prop: signal detection before form-fill

**Status:** completed

## 20:52 — E2E tests for demo/onboarding flow

**Task:** Add comprehensive E2E tests for the critical demo and onboarding flows

**Changes:**
- e2e/demo.spec.ts — Created new test file with 14 comprehensive tests covering landing page, demo flow, registration, login, pricing, API docs, navigation, features, integrations, FAQ, comparison table, product mockup, CTA, and footer

**Test coverage added:**
1. Landing page loads and shows key elements (hero section, CTA buttons, main sections)
2. Demo seed creates environment and redirects to dashboard (tests the live demo button)
3. Registration page loads correctly (form fields and buttons)
4. Login page loads correctly (form fields and buttons)
5. Pricing page displays all tiers (Free, Pro, Growth, Scale with pricing)
6. API docs page loads (Swagger UI)
7. Landing page navigation links work (Features, How It Works, Pricing)
8. Landing page features section displays all features (6 key features)
9. Landing page shows integration logos (GitHub, npm, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce)
10. Landing page FAQ section is interactive (accordion expand/collapse)
11. Landing page comparison table shows DevSignal advantages (vs Common Room, Reo.dev)
12. Landing page product mockup is displayed (Top Accounts, Live Signal Feed)
13. Landing page bottom CTA is visible (final conversion section)
14. Footer contains all expected links (Features, Use Cases, Pricing, Developers, etc.)

**Decisions:**
- Followed existing E2E test patterns from auth.spec.ts and navigation.spec.ts
- Used semantic selectors (getByRole, getByText, getByLabel) for better test stability
- Added appropriate timeouts for async operations (demo seed, API docs loading)
- Made tests comprehensive yet maintainable - each test is focused on a specific area
- Tests are designed to work against the running dev server (localhost:5173)

**Status:** completed

## 21:30 — Implement BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for Anthropic API

**Task:** Enable customers to provide their own Anthropic API keys so they pay their own Claude bill instead of using a shared global key.

**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/ai-engine.ts — Replaced global singleton client with per-org cached clients; added `getClientForOrg()` that reads API key from org settings JSON; added `clearClientCache()` to invalidate cache when key changes; updated all 3 AI functions to use per-org clients
- backend/src/controllers/ai.ts — Added `saveApiKey()` controller (OWNER/ADMIN only) to save/update org's API key with validation; added `getAiConfig()` to return masked key status; updated all error handlers to check for "API key not configured" instead of "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" and return 402 (payment required) instead of 503
- backend/src/routes/ai.ts — Added two new endpoints: GET /config (get AI config status) and PUT /config/api-key (save API key)

**Decisions:**
- No encryption needed for MVP — the database is already secured and this matches how other credentials (GitHub tokens, Slack tokens) are stored
- Used 402 Payment Required status code to signal frontend to show upgrade/config prompt
- API key validation ensures it starts with "sk-ant-" (Anthropic format)
- Cache invalidation on key update ensures immediate effect
- Masked key display (first 10 chars + "...") for security

**Technical details:**
- Per-org client caching using `Map<string, Anthropic>` prevents recreating clients on every API call
- Settings JSON column already exists on Organization model (no schema changes needed)
- Role check uses existing `req.orgRole` from auth middleware
- Error messages guide users to Settings > AI Configuration

**Status:** completed
