## 01:00 — Intercom connector, rate limiting, SEO meta tags

**Task:** Complete Cycle 4: Intercom support ticket connector, security hardening via rate limiting, and SEO meta tags

**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/intercom-connector.ts — Full Intercom connector: webhook-driven signal ingestion (conversation open/reply/close/rated), API polling sync for conversations, HMAC-SHA1 signature verification, identity resolution (email → name → Intercom user ID)
- backend/src/routes/intercom-connector.ts — REST routes: POST /webhook/:sourceId (public, HMAC-verified), POST /connect, GET /status, POST /sync, DELETE /disconnect
- backend/src/jobs/queue.ts — Added INTERCOM_SYNC queue and IntercomSyncJobData interface
- backend/src/jobs/producers.ts — Added enqueueIntercomSync producer function
- backend/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts — Extracted 5 rate limiters: auth (5/min), api (100/min), webhook (200/min), demo (3/min), signal (500/min)
- backend/src/app.ts — Replaced inline rate limiters with middleware imports, registered Intercom connector routes
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma — Added INTERCOM to SignalSourceType and IdentityType enums
- backend/prisma/migrations/20260216010000_add_intercom_signal_source_type/ — Migration for INTERCOM enum values
- frontend/index.html — Added SEO meta tags: Open Graph, Twitter Cards, description, canonical URL, theme-color, favicon links

**Decisions:**
- Intercom webhook verification uses HMAC-SHA1 (matching Intercom's X-Hub-Signature header format)
- Rate limiters use in-memory store; documented Redis store swap for multi-instance deployments
- Forgot-password endpoint added to auth limiter scope

**Status:** completed

## 14:30 — Frontend settings UI for Intercom and Zendesk connectors

**Task:** Build frontend settings UI tabs for Intercom and Zendesk connectors in the Settings page

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx — Added IntercomStatus and ZendeskStatus interfaces, added 'intercom' and 'zendesk' to TabId union type, added tabs to TABS array, added tab rendering blocks with lazy mount, added IntercomIcon and ZendeskIcon inline SVG components, added INTERCOM_EVENTS and ZENDESK_EVENTS constant arrays, added full IntercomTab component (connect form with access token, webhook secret, event checkboxes; connected state with webhook URL copy, signal stats grid, sync results, sync/disconnect actions), added full ZendeskTab component (connect form with subdomain+suffix input, email, API token, webhook secret, event checkboxes; connected state with subdomain display, webhook URL copy, signal stats grid, sync results, sync/disconnect actions)

**Decisions:**
- Kept both components inline in Settings.tsx to match the existing monolithic pattern (all other connector tabs are in the same file)
- Intercom uses blue accent color (#286EFA) matching brand; Zendesk uses emerald (#03363D) matching brand
- Intercom access token is optional (supports webhook-only mode); Zendesk requires subdomain+email+API token (mandatory for API auth)
- All event types checked by default for both connectors
- Followed exact same state management, polling, error handling, and UI card patterns as PostHog/Reddit/StackOverflow tabs

**Status:** completed

## 18:45 — Load testing setup for Show HN traffic simulation

**Task:** Create a pure Node.js load test suite to validate DevSignal can handle 2,000-5,000 visitors in 4 hours (Show HN traffic pattern)
**Changes:**
- tests/load/run.js — Main load test runner: CLI args (--quick, --duration N), pre-flight connectivity check, automatic auth via demo/seed, phased traffic simulation with ramping concurrency, JSON report export
- tests/load/config.js — Endpoint definitions with weighted traffic distribution (9 endpoints, 40% landing page / 10% health / 10% API docs / 10% demo status / 5% demo seed / 10% companies / 5% signals / 5% auth login / 5% contacts), 4-phase traffic profile (ramp-up 15min / peak 90min / sustained 60min / tail 75min), and quick-test profile for CI
- tests/load/http-client.js — Minimal HTTP client built on node:http/https with keep-alive connection pooling (256 sockets), timeout handling, and latency measurement via hrtime
- tests/load/stats.js — Statistics collector with per-endpoint latency percentiles (P50/P95/P99/min/max/mean), status code distribution, RPS tracking (sustained/peak), max concurrent connections, formatted terminal report
- tests/load/README.md — Usage docs, traffic pattern visualization, environment variables, results interpretation guide
- package.json — Added test:load and test:load:quick scripts
- .gitignore — Added tests/load/results/ to ignore generated reports

**Decisions:**
- Used pure Node.js (node:http, node:https) instead of autocannon or external packages to keep zero external dependencies
- Traffic weights reflect realistic Show HN visitor behavior: majority hit landing page, small fraction explores API
- Rate-limited endpoints (demo/seed at 3/min, auth at 5/min) are included intentionally — 429s validate that rate limiting works under load
- Auto-obtains JWT auth via POST /api/v1/demo/seed so authenticated endpoints can be tested without manual setup
- Quick mode (--quick) runs in ~60 seconds for CI/pre-deploy smoke testing
- Reports saved as JSON for CI integration and trend analysis

**Status:** completed

## 21:00 — Comprehensive interactive API documentation page

**Task:** Rebuild the /docs API documentation page with full endpoint coverage, search, rate limits, and expandable sections

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/ApiDocs.tsx — Complete rewrite of the API documentation page with:
  - 21 endpoint categories covering all 120+ REST API endpoints (Auth, Organizations, Contacts, Companies, Deals, Activities, Signals, Workflows, Playbooks, Scoring, Email Sequences, Connectors, Webhooks, Webhook Subscriptions, Analytics, Identity Resolution, Enrichment, Bulk Operations, Dashboards, Team Members, API Keys, Search, AI Engine)
  - Search/filter functionality with keyboard shortcut (/) to find endpoints by method, path, or description
  - Expandable/collapsible sections for each endpoint group with endpoint count badges
  - Expandable endpoint rows showing request body and response JSON examples with syntax highlighting
  - Rate limit reference table (5 tiers: auth 5/min, api 100/min, webhook 200/min, demo 3/min, signal 500/min)
  - Authentication section covering JWT, API Keys, and SSO (SAML/OIDC)
  - Quick Start guide with SDK installation, TypeScript, and curl examples
  - PLG pipeline stages, workflow trigger events, and webhook event types reference
  - Error handling reference with HTTP status codes
  - Sticky sidebar navigation with active section tracking via IntersectionObserver
  - Mobile-responsive with collapsible sidebar and mobile search
  - Dark theme matching existing design system

**Decisions:**
- Kept all data inline rather than fetching from OpenAPI spec to ensure the page loads instantly without backend dependency (important for pre-login evaluation)
- Used dangerouslySetInnerHTML for syntax highlighting in code blocks to avoid adding a syntax highlighting library dependency
- First 3 endpoint categories default to expanded; rest are collapsed to keep initial view clean
- Search filters across category labels, descriptions, endpoint paths, methods, and descriptions

**Status:** completed
