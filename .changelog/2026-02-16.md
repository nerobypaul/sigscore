## 01:00 — Intercom connector, rate limiting, SEO meta tags

**Task:** Complete Cycle 4: Intercom support ticket connector, security hardening via rate limiting, and SEO meta tags

**Changes:**
- backend/src/services/intercom-connector.ts — Full Intercom connector: webhook-driven signal ingestion (conversation open/reply/close/rated), API polling sync for conversations, HMAC-SHA1 signature verification, identity resolution (email → name → Intercom user ID)
- backend/src/routes/intercom-connector.ts — REST routes: POST /webhook/:sourceId (public, HMAC-verified), POST /connect, GET /status, POST /sync, DELETE /disconnect
- backend/src/jobs/queue.ts — Added INTERCOM_SYNC queue and IntercomSyncJobData interface
- backend/src/jobs/producers.ts — Added enqueueIntercomSync producer function
- backend/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts — Extracted 5 rate limiters: auth (5/min), api (100/min), webhook (200/min), demo (3/min), signal (500/min)
- backend/src/app.ts — Replaced inline rate limiters with middleware imports, registered Intercom connector routes
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma — Added INTERCOM to SignalSourceType and IdentityType enums
- backend/prisma/migrations/20260216010000_add_intercom_signal_source_type/ — Migration for INTERCOM enum values
- frontend/index.html — Added SEO meta tags: Open Graph, Twitter Cards, description, canonical URL, theme-color, favicon links

**Decisions:**
- Intercom webhook verification uses HMAC-SHA1 (matching Intercom's X-Hub-Signature header format)
- Rate limiters use in-memory store; documented Redis store swap for multi-instance deployments
- Forgot-password endpoint added to auth limiter scope

**Status:** completed

## 14:30 — Frontend settings UI for Intercom and Zendesk connectors

**Task:** Build frontend settings UI tabs for Intercom and Zendesk connectors in the Settings page

**Changes:**
- frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx — Added IntercomStatus and ZendeskStatus interfaces, added 'intercom' and 'zendesk' to TabId union type, added tabs to TABS array, added tab rendering blocks with lazy mount, added IntercomIcon and ZendeskIcon inline SVG components, added INTERCOM_EVENTS and ZENDESK_EVENTS constant arrays, added full IntercomTab component (connect form with access token, webhook secret, event checkboxes; connected state with webhook URL copy, signal stats grid, sync results, sync/disconnect actions), added full ZendeskTab component (connect form with subdomain+suffix input, email, API token, webhook secret, event checkboxes; connected state with subdomain display, webhook URL copy, signal stats grid, sync results, sync/disconnect actions)

**Decisions:**
- Kept both components inline in Settings.tsx to match the existing monolithic pattern (all other connector tabs are in the same file)
- Intercom uses blue accent color (#286EFA) matching brand; Zendesk uses emerald (#03363D) matching brand
- Intercom access token is optional (supports webhook-only mode); Zendesk requires subdomain+email+API token (mandatory for API auth)
- All event types checked by default for both connectors
- Followed exact same state management, polling, error handling, and UI card patterns as PostHog/Reddit/StackOverflow tabs

**Status:** completed
