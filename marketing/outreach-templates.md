## Template 1: Engineering Leader

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company] developer usage

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Genuine question -- do you know which developers using [Product] are actually deploying it in production vs. just kicking the tires?

Most devtool eng teams I talk to have great product telemetry but no way to connect GitHub activity, npm installs, community questions, and actual product usage back to a single account.

I built DevSignal to solve this. It pulls signals from 16 sources, resolves identities, and scores accounts 0-100 so your team stops guessing.

It's open source (MIT) and self-hostable: https://github.com/nerobypaul/headless-crm

Or try the live demo: https://devsignal.dev

Worth 10 minutes to see if it fits?

## Template 2: DevRel Lead

**Subject:** Tracking community signals at [Company]

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I've been following the [Product] community -- you're doing great work on [specific thing: Discord, docs, conference talks, etc.].

Honest question: how much time do you spend manually tracking who's active in Discord, who's filing issues on GitHub, who's asking about [Product] on Stack Overflow? My guess is a lot, and it's still incomplete.

DevSignal aggregates all of that automatically. It connects GitHub, Discord, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Twitter/X activity into one timeline per developer, so you can see who your champions actually are -- not who you think they are.

Free to self-host, open source: https://github.com/nerobypaul/headless-crm

## Template 3: Growth/Marketing Lead (tried Common Room or similar)

**Subject:** After Common Room

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

If you've evaluated Common Room or Reo.dev for [Company], you already understand the problem -- developer signals are scattered across 15+ platforms and nobody connects them.

The issue is price. $1K+/mo for Common Room is hard to justify at a Series A/B devtool when the data quality is still noisy.

I built DevSignal as an open-source alternative. Same signal aggregation (16 sources), identity resolution, and AI-powered account scoring. Self-hosted is free. Managed starts at $0/mo and tops out at $299/mo for unlimited everything.

The tradeoff: it's earlier-stage software. But it's MIT licensed, so you own your data and your pipeline.

## Template 4: Founder/CEO (proving PMF to investors)

**Subject:** Proving [Company] PMF with signal data

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

When your board asks "how do you know developers love [Product]?" -- what do you show them? GitHub stars? MRR? Neither tells the real story.

DevSignal tracks the signals that actually indicate product-market fit in devtools: repeat usage patterns, community engagement velocity, organic mentions, package install growth tied to real accounts. It scores every account 0-100 so you can show investors exactly how your developer base is maturing.

It's open source and free to self-host. I built it specifically for Series A-C devtool companies because the existing tools (Common Room at $1K+/mo) are priced for enterprises, not startups.

5-minute demo: https://devsignal.dev

GitHub: https://github.com/nerobypaul/headless-crm

Happy to walk through what the data looks like for a company at your stage.

## Template 5: Sales Lead

**Subject:** Better leads than form fills

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

At most devtool companies, sales waits for demo requests and form fills. But developers don't fill out forms -- they install packages, read docs, open issues, and talk in Discord.

By the time a developer requests a demo, they've already decided. The opportunity is catching them 3 weeks earlier when they're evaluating.

DevSignal surfaces those signals. It tracks activity across GitHub, npm, community channels, and product usage, then scores accounts so you see who's heating up before they ever hit your pricing page.

Not a CRM -- it feeds into whatever you already use (HubSpot, Salesforce, or just Slack alerts).
