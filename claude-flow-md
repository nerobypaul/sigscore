Production-ready multi-agent AI orchestration for Claude Code
Deploy 60+ specialized agents in coordinated swarms with self-learning capabilities, fault-tolerant consensus, and enterprise-grade security.

Getting into the Flow
Claude-Flow is a comprehensive AI agent orchestration framework that transforms Claude Code into a powerful multi-agent development platform. It enables teams to deploy, coordinate, and optimize specialized AI agents working together on complex software engineering tasks.

Self-Learning/Self-Optimizing Agent Architecture

Key Capabilities
🤖 60+ Specialized Agents - Ready-to-use AI agents for coding, code review, testing, security audits, documentation, and DevOps. Each agent is optimized for its specific role.

🐝 Coordinated Agent Teams - Run unlimited agents simultaneously in organized swarms. Agents spawn sub-workers, communicate, share context, and divide work automatically using hierarchical (queen/workers) or mesh (peer-to-peer) patterns.

🧠 Learns From Your Workflow - The system remembers what works. Successful patterns are stored and reused, routing similar tasks to the best-performing agents. Gets smarter over time.

🔌 Works With Any LLM - Switch between Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cohere, or local models like Llama. Automatic failover if one provider is unavailable. Smart routing picks the cheapest option that meets quality requirements.

⚡ Plugs Into Claude Code - Native integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Use claude-flow commands directly in your Claude Code sessions with full tool access.

🔒 Production-Ready Security - Built-in protection against prompt injection, input validation, path traversal prevention, command injection blocking, and safe credential handling.

🧩 Extensible Plugin System - Add custom capabilities with the plugin SDK. Create workers, hooks, providers, and security modules. Share plugins via the decentralized IPFS marketplace.

Claude Code: With vs Without Claude-Flow
Capability	Claude Code Alone	Claude Code + Claude-Flow
Agent Collaboration	Agents work in isolation, no shared context	Agents collaborate via swarms with shared memory and consensus
Coordination	Manual orchestration between tasks	Queen-led hierarchy with 5 consensus algorithms (Raft, Byzantine, Gossip)
Hive Mind	⛔ Not available	🐝 Queen-led swarms with collective intelligence, 3 queen types, 8 worker types
Consensus	⛔ No multi-agent decisions	Byzantine fault-tolerant voting (f < n/3), weighted, majority
Memory	Session-only, no persistence	HNSW vector memory with 150x-12,500x faster retrieval
Vector Database	⛔ No native support	🐘 RuVector PostgreSQL with 77+ SQL functions, ~61µs search, 16,400 QPS
Collective Memory	⛔ No shared knowledge	Shared knowledge base with LRU cache, SQLite persistence, 8 memory types
Learning	Static behavior, no adaptation	SONA self-learning with <0.05ms adaptation, improves over time
Task Routing	You decide which agent to use	Intelligent routing based on learned patterns (89% accuracy)
Complex Tasks	Manual breakdown required	Automatic decomposition across 5 domains (Security, Core, Integration, Support)
Background Workers	Nothing runs automatically	12 context-triggered workers auto-dispatch on file changes, patterns, sessions
LLM Provider	Anthropic only	6 providers with automatic failover and cost-based routing (85% savings)
Security	Standard protections	CVE-hardened with bcrypt, input validation, path traversal prevention
Performance	Baseline	2.8-4.4x faster tasks, 10-20x faster swarm spawning, 84.8% SWE-Bench
Quick Start
Prerequisites
Node.js 20+ (required)
npm 9+ / pnpm / bun package manager
IMPORTANT: Claude Code must be installed first:

# 1. Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. (Optional) Skip permissions check for faster setup
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
Installation
One-Line Install (Recommended)
# curl-style installer with progress display
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ruvnet/claude-flow@main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Full setup (global + MCP + diagnostics)
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ruvnet/claude-flow@main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --full
Install Options
npm/npx Install
# Quick start (no install needed)
npx claude-flow@alpha init

# Or install globally
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha
claude-flow init

# With Bun (faster)
bunx claude-flow@alpha init
Install Profiles
Profile	Size	Use Case

Basic Usage
# Initialize project
npx claude-flow@alpha init

# Start MCP server for Claude Code integration
npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start

# Run a task with agents
npx claude-flow@alpha --agent coder --task "Implement user authentication"

# List available agents
npx claude-flow@alpha --list
Upgrading
# Update helpers and statusline (preserves your data)

# Update AND add any missing skills/agents/commands
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init upgrade --add-missing
The --add-missing flag automatically detects and installs new skills, agents, and commands that were added in newer versions, without overwriting your existing customizations.

Claude Code MCP Integration
Add claude-flow as an MCP server for seamless integration:

# Add claude-flow MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx -y claude-flow@latest mcp start

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
Once added, Claude Code can use all 175+ claude-flow MCP tools directly:

swarm_init - Initialize agent swarms
agent_spawn - Spawn specialized agents
memory_search - Search patterns with HNSW (150x faster)
hooks_route - Intelligent task routing
And 170+ more tools...
