# Headless CRM - Frontend

React-based admin UI for the Headless CRM system.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- TanStack Query
- React Router

## TODO

The frontend is scaffolded but not fully implemented. Key components to build:

- Authentication pages (login, register)
- Dashboard with metrics
- Contact management pages
- Company management pages
- Deal pipeline view
- Activity tracking
- User settings

## Development

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.
