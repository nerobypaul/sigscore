# DevSignal Cold Outreach Templates

Three templates for reaching Heads of Growth / first GTM hires at devtool companies. Each under 100 words. Personalize the bracketed fields.

## Template 1: "I looked at your npm downloads"

**Subject:** [package-name] is growing fast

Hey [First Name],

I was looking at [package-name] on npm -- [X]k downloads last month, up [Y]% from 3 months ago. Nice trajectory.

Quick question: do you know which of those downloads are from companies that might pay for [Product]?

We built DevSignal to answer exactly that. It ingests npm/PyPI/GitHub signals and tells you which developers are ready for outreach.

$79/mo. No HubSpot required.

Worth a 15-min look?

## Template 2: "Your GitHub stars don't pay bills"

**Subject:** [X]k stars, but who's actually paying?

Hey [First Name],

[Company] has [X]k GitHub stars. That's impressive for awareness. But I'm curious -- how do you know when a star turns into a paying customer?

Most devtool teams can't answer that. The signal data (stars, forks, npm installs, API usage) lives in 5 different systems and nobody cross-references it.

We built a CRM that does this natively. Developer signals in, pipeline out.

Free tier if you want to poke around: devsignal.dev

## Template 3: "Quick question about [Company] growth"

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]

Hey [First Name],

Saw [Company] just [hit a milestone / launched feature / raised round]. Congrats.

Genuine question: as you scale the developer base, how are you identifying which free users are ready to convert?

We're building in this space and talking to devtool growth teams. Would love 15 minutes to hear how you think about it -- even if DevSignal isn't relevant yet.

No pitch, just learning.

## Usage Notes

- **Template 1** works best when you can cite real npm/PyPI numbers. Pull them before sending. Takes 30 seconds on npmjs.com.
- **Template 2** works best for companies with large open source presence but unclear monetization path.
- **Template 3** is the softest touch. Use when you don't have a clear data hook. Best sent after they post on Twitter/LinkedIn about growth.
- **Send from founder email.** Not marketing@. Not sales@. A human name at a real domain.
- **Follow up once, 4 days later.** Not three times. Not "just bumping this up." One follow-up: "Hey, know you're busy. Link's here if useful: devsignal.dev"
