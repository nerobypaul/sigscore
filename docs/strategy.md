# DevSignal — Strategy & Positioning

> Last updated: 2026-02-14

## Category
**Developer Pipeline Intelligence** — not "headless CRM", not "PLG CRM"

## Tagline
"Turn developer signals into pipeline"

## One-liner
DevSignal tracks npm downloads, GitHub activity, API usage, and product signals — then tells you which developers are ready to buy. Purpose-built for devtool companies.

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

| Dimension | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | Head of Growth, first GTM hire, or founder doing GTM |
| **Company stage** | Series A-B (15-100 employees) |
| **Company type** | Developer tools with PLG motion |
| **Trigger** | First enterprise deal, outgrowing spreadsheets, HubSpot feels wrong |
| **Budget** | $79-299/mo (not $1k+/mo) |
| **Anti-ICP** | Enterprise companies (>500 people), non-devtool SaaS, companies without PLG |

### Target Companies (Tier 1)
Resend, Railway, Neon, Inngest, Knock, Upstash, Trigger.dev, Axiom, Dub, Unkey, Convex, Turso, Drizzle, tRPC, Hono, Val Town, Fly.io, Render, PlanetScale, Supabase

### Why these companies?
- They have open source + paid product (PLG motion)
- They have npm/PyPI packages with download signals
- They have GitHub repos with star/fork/issue signals
- Their growth teams are small (1-5 people) and need automation
- HubSpot/Salesforce is overkill for their stage

## USP (Unique Selling Proposition)
DevSignal is the only product that combines:
1. **Native developer signal ingestion** (npm, PyPI, GitHub, Segment) — no middleware needed
2. **CRM with PLG-native pipeline** — stages built for how devtools sell
3. **AI-powered account intelligence** — briefs, enrichment, next-best-actions
4. **Workflow automation** — trigger actions when signals hit thresholds
5. **All at indie-friendly pricing** — $79-299/mo, not $1k+/mo

### Positioning: "Reo.Dev + Attio in one box"
- Reo.Dev has developer signals but no CRM
- Attio has a great CRM but no native developer signals
- DevSignal combines both in one product

## Competitive Landscape

### The PLG CRM Graveyard
| Company | Raised | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Calixa | $16.3M | Shut down Jan 2024 |
| Koala | $15M | Acqui-hired by Cursor, product sunset Sep 2025 |
| Endgame | $17M+ | Pivoted to AI enterprise sales |

### Key lesson: "PLG CRM for everyone" fails. DevSignal wins by being specifically for devtools.

### Active Competitors
| Competitor | Pricing | Gap |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Pocus | Custom (enterprise) | Pivoted away from PLG focus, expensive |
| Common Room | $1k+/mo | 5-12x more expensive than DevSignal |
| Reo.Dev | Custom | Signals only, no CRM |
| Attio | $29-119/user/mo | No native developer signals |
| June.so | Custom | Analytics only, not a CRM |
| HubSpot | $0-3,600/mo | Not built for PLG, requires custom setup |

## Buyer Psychology

### The buyer is NOT "Sales"
- In PLG devtool companies, the free→paid funnel is owned by Growth, not Sales
- The word "sales" alienates developer-led companies
- Position DevSignal as a GROWTH tool

### The "aha moment" in a demo
Open the Account 360 page for a real account. Show:
1. "This company installed your npm package 3x this week"
2. "Their CTO starred your repo"
3. "API usage is up 40%"
4. AI brief: "Here's what's happening and what to do next"

That's the moment the Head of Growth says "I need this."

## Pricing Strategy
- **Free ($0):** 1,000 contacts, 5,000 signals/mo — for indie builders exploring PLG
- **Pro ($79/mo):** 25,000 contacts, 100,000 signals — for teams turning signals into pipeline
- **Scale ($299/mo):** Unlimited — for companies scaling growth org-wide

The $79 price point is aggressive but intentional — it's 5-12x cheaper than alternatives and removes the "let me get budget approval" blocker for a Head of Growth with a credit card.

## Product Roadmap Priorities
1. **Segment connector** (DONE) — removes "how do I get data in?" blocker
2. **Account 360 + AI** (DONE) — the demo closer
3. **Saved views / smart lists** (DONE) — the daily-use feature
4. **Slack bot (bi-directional)** — makes DevSignal ambient in team workflow
5. **Email sequences** — outreach from within the product
6. **HubSpot/Salesforce import** — migration path for prospects already on CRM
