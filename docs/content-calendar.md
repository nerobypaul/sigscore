## Content Principles

1. **Be a builder, not a marketer.** Share what we're building, what we're learning, what's hard. No corporate voice.
2. **Data over opinions.** Cite npm numbers, GitHub stats, funding amounts, pricing comparisons. Be specific.
3. **One insight per piece.** Each thread, each post, each email should have one clear takeaway.
4. **Engage, don't broadcast.** Reply to every comment. Ask questions. Thank people. Be a human.
5. **Show the product, don't describe it.** Screenshots, GIFs, code snippets > feature lists.
